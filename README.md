SCENARIO

You are a Data Analyst consultant at Lapage, a large and highly reputable generalist online bookstore. You report directly to the Marketing department.

Lapage was originally a physical bookstore with several points of sale. But given the success of some of its products and the enthusiasm of its customers, she decided two years ago to open an online sales site. 

You intervene because the company wants to take stock after two years of practice, and to be able to analyse its strengths, weaknesses, customer behaviour, etc.

You have access to this data, extracted directly from the company's database to CSV files. Here are the files at your disposal:

•	products;

•	transactions.

SKILLS ASSESSED

•	Perform bivariate analysis to interpret data

YOUR MISSIONS

MISSION NO. 1

•	An analysis of the various sales indicators:

o	different indicators and graphs around turnover;

o	the development over time and set up a moving average decomposition to assess the overall trend;

o	to zoom in on the references, to see the tops and flops, the breakdown by category, etc.;

o	some information on the profiles of our clients, and also the distribution of turnover between them, for example via a Lorenz curve.

MISSION NO. 2

•	A more focused analysis on customers: the objective this time would be to understand the behaviour of our customers online, in order to then be able to compare with the knowledge acquired through our physical libraries:

o	The relationship between a customer's gender and the categories of books purchased;

o	And then the relationship between the age of customers and the total amount purchased, frequency of purchase, average basket size and categories of books purchased.
